# CUSTOM CONFIG
-------

This is a simple shell script to backup custom configuration of a user on macOS.
This can help in quickly setting up a new machine or in case of a reset.

### Currently backing up:
1. Custom shell scripts
2. ZSH config
3. List of packages installed through Homebrew 
4. CRON table
